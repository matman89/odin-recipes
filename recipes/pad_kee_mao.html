        <li>1.5 teaspoons olive oil</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the dry rice noodles in a bowl, cover with hot water, 
            and let soak until white and softened, about 1 hour. Drain the noodles, and set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat 1 1/2 teaspoon of olive oil in a wok or large skillet over low heat, and cook and stir 
            2 minced garlic cloves until brown and beginning to crisp, 2 to 3 minutes. 
            Stir in the soaked noodles, 1/2 teaspoon of thick soy sauce, and 2 teaspoons of sugar, 
            and cook and stir until the noodles have absorbed the soy sauce and turned brown, 
            about 3 minutes. Remove the noodles from the skillet.</li>
        <li>Heat the remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons of olive oil in the wok over low heat; 
            stir in the remaining 2 minced garlic cloves, 
            and cook until brown and beginning to crisp, 2 to 3 minutes. 
            Raise the heat to medium-high, and stir in the pork, serrano pepper, basil, 
            1/2 teaspoon thick soy sauce, 1 teaspoon sugar, and salt. 
            Cook and stir until the pork is no longer pink and the edges of the meat are beginning to brown, 
            about 5 minutes. Return the noodles to the wok, and stir in the bean sprouts. 
            Cook and stir until heated through, about 5 more minutes.</li>
